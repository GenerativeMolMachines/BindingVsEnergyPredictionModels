# BindingVsEnergyPredictionModels
Models for predicting binding, mfe and affinity between different structures and complexes

This module was created to enrich the knowledge graph and create new connections based on machine learning models.

Each unit has been taken from open source works, and **we do not claim to have appropriated the developments**. The description for each block will include references to the sources.
